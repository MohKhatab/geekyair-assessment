# GeekyAir Assessment – Landing Page Implementation

## Overview

This repository is my submission for the **GeekyAir** assessment. It contains a landing page implemented in **React** based on a Figma design. I recreated the layout, interactions, and animations in code while trying to stay faithful to the original design.

## Tech Stack

* React
* Shadcn UI
* Tailwind CSS
* Framer Motion
* React Router
* Swiper

These libraries help keep the UI consistent, responsive, and animation-friendly.

##  Project Structure

```
src/
  components/
    common/            -> Shared UI (Navbar, Footer, Section, Title, InfiniteScroll)
    landing/           -> Components + subfolders for each landing page section
  ui/                  -> Shadcn UI components
  hooks/               -> Custom reusable hooks
  layouts/
    DefaultLayout.tsx  -> Wraps pages with Navbar + Footer (useful for future pages, auth, dashboards, etc.)
  lib/                 -> Generated by Shadcn (utility functions)
  pages/               -> Individual pages

App.tsx
```

I organized the project to isolate landing sections, encourage component reuse, and allow the codebase to scale if more pages or features are added.

## Design Interpretation Notes

The Hero section in the Figma design placed the main image fixed to the right, which created large empty gaps between the text and the image on wider screens. To improve balance and readability, I switched to a more centered layout where both elements stay visually connected across different screen sizes.

The Figma file also had inconsistent spacing and didn’t seem to follow a grid or a standard spacing scale. To create a cleaner and more structured layout, I applied Tailwind’s 8px spacing scale across most of the project. This keeps spacing predictable and aligns with common UI/UX standards.

The Navbar in the design had a noticeable empty gap above it, and its inner elements touched the bottom edge of the bar. I wasn’t sure if this was intentional, so I opted for a more standard layout: a clean rectangle with properly centered content.

The required infinite scrolling animation was implemented in the Brands section directly under the Hero. I built a reusable component named InfiniteScrollVertical located in src/components/common/ to handle continuous vertical scrolling.

The Value Proposition section also had unclear spacing, especially large gaps between the two columns. I explored two different solutions:
- Simple scroll-based reveal: elements fade and translate in as the user scrolls.
- Scroll-locked reveal: the scroll is temporarily hijacked to reveal each value one-by-one. (branch: feature/value-scroll)

Both solutions demonstrate different ways to handle the spacing ambiguity and improve user interaction.
